      <h1>about me</h1>
      <p>
        👋 Hi, I’m Benjamin. I'm a junior programmer and data-scientist looking
        for entry-level roles in the Manchester area. As well as the languages I
        can write in (Python, Javascript, C, SQL, HTML, CSS, LUA) I also bring a
        background in creative-writing and graphic design from my previous work
        as an artist and author.
      </p>
      <p>
        👀 I’m interested in coding as a communicative medium! I get really
        excited for clean, elegant code. I'm also very interested in using my
        data science toolset to reveal new stories from complicated datasets.
      </p>
      <p>
        🌱 I’m currently studying an MSc in Computer Science with Big Data
        Analytics. I'm also undertaking short courses in data visualisation and
        communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with translating
        complicated data into compelling, accessible stories. I'm also
        interested in any projects concerning human-rights, data-journalism, or
        making music.
      </p>
